Notes on the model
Inputs: Age, goals, deal-breakers, preparedness.

Base rates: You control base infidelity and divorce assumptions via sliders.

Bonuses: Your inputs produce a total bonus that reduces base infidelity and divorce rates.

Overlap sensitivity: The chart shows failure under 20%, 30%, and 40% overlap assumptions across a spectrum of definition breadth.

Best-case percentage: The main success display caps at about 67%. The chart shows failure rates directly; subtract from 100 to interpret success without the cap.
